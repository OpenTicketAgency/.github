# âœ¨ Welcome to the Open Ticket Agency!

Open Ticket Agency is an open source code base for smart contracts and reference web applications that implement ticketing systems on the Ethereum blockchain.

The goal of this project is to create a reference implementation of a ticket sales system on the Ethereum blockchain. This system will be designed to be as flexible as possible so that it can be used as is or as a base for other projects. As such, it can be used by any event organizer to build their own ticket sales system or to customize it to their needs.
